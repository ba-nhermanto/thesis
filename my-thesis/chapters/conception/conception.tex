\section{Software Design}
the model-view-viewmodel follows the seperation of concerns principles blablabla
The MVVM pattern promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns, making the application more maintainable and testable. The View and ViewModel are often connected using data binding techniques, allowing automatic synchronization of data between the two.
By following MVVM, developers can achieve a clear separation of responsibilities, allowing for easier development, testing, and maintenance of the application.
