\section{Software Design}
Software design is an important phase in software development process that lays foundation for building a well-structured and functional software systems. 
It outlines a strategy to transform the requirements of the application defined in \autoref{chap:requirements} into a well-defined and structured application.
As the project follows the MVVM architectural pattern, the application is divided into three components: \emph{model}, \emph{view}, \emph{view model}. 

\subsection{Model}
The \emph{model} represents the business logic to solve the problems listed as the requirements of the systems. Once the use cases outlined in \autoref{chap:requirements} are analyzed, the functions of each system components can be determined and then a sequence of operations can be created for each specific use case.

\subsection{View}
\subsection{ViewModel}
