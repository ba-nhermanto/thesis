\section{System Architecture}
In this section, an architecture diagram is displayed to have a better understanding of the system architecture as well as its components.

\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:sys_diagram} illustrates the components of the systems and the interaction between the components. Within the system, there are two components: the user interface and the backend which connects to a local database to store and manage data.
In addition, the device sensor is connected to the backend via bluetooth low energy and transmit the user's heart rate.
